## About Laravel

Using the Laravel PHP framework, create a basic “virtual wallet” application which satisfies the following user stories.

- As a User, I can sign up for a User account, so that I can access the application. +
- As a User, I can login to my account.  +
- As a User, I can logout of my account.  +
- As a User, I can create a virtual Wallet. +
 - As a User, I can view a list of my virtual Wallet.
- As a User, I can rename my virtual Wallet.
- As a User, I can delete a virtual Wallet.
- As a User, I can add a Transaction to a virtual Wallet.
- As a User, I can see all the Transactions in my virtual Wallet.
- As a User, I can delete Transaction from a virtual Wallet.
- As a User, I can mark Transaction as Fraudulent.
- As a User, I see total sum of Transactions in virtual Wallet separated in incoming and outgoing transactions.
- It is important that you demonstrate an understanding of VCS during this test. Git is favourable. The use of services such as GitHub, Gitlab or BitBucket is not required. A local git repository is sufficient for this demonstration. Use as much of the framework as possible.

Quick Start
If you don't have an development environment for Laravel already, consider using the Bitnami Laravel Development Container.

- $ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-laravel/master/docker-compose.yml
- $ docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
- In this test the following shall be considered:
- Use of Tests
- Solution Design
- Solution Implementation
- Adherence to User Stories
- All tests must run successfully or be annotated correctly (i.e. @incomplete).
- Feel free to add a document in the root of the repository stating any assumptions, justifications and ideas for further development.
